# Tracking Carbon Emissions in Europe

## Project Description
This project aims to create an interactive web map that visualizes carbon emissions across European countries on a per capita basis. The map highlights countries with both high and low carbon emissions, allowing users to explore trends, compare data, and understand the factors influencing emissions. The goal is to provide a tool for policymakers, environmental organizations, and the general public to better understand carbon emissions and identify strategies for reducing them.

## Project Goal
The primary goal of this project is to deliver a clear and interactive visualization of carbon emissions in Europe, emphasizing the importance of per capita measurements to ensure fair comparisons between countries of different sizes. By highlighting both high and low emissions countries, the project aims to:
- Raise awareness about the impact of population growth and energy consumption on carbon emissions.
- Encourage discussions on effective strategies for reducing carbon footprints.
- Provide a resource for policymakers, educators, and the public to explore and compare emissions data.

## Main Functions
